# Image-Classification-using-CNN-for-Beginners
A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The pre-processing required in a Convent is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms
